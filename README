The plugin implements an enhanced version of vim's incrementing features with
<C-A> and <C-X> using functions to find and replace strings according to any
inline scheme.

By default vim behaviour is emulated, plus it cycles through names of months
and week days (trying full name, then abbreviated).

The language for months and week days is English, but it is fairly straight
forward to localise this. An example of localisation is provided in the
documentation.

Extra functions meant to assist in writing new functions are included, too.
